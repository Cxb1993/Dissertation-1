I would like to thank my advisor, Hector, for introducing me to the Immersed Boundary Method and for his support of my research. I would also like to thank our collaborator on these works, Alex Roma, for his insightful discussion and for being a generous host during my stays at Universidade de S\~ao Paulo. Thanks as well to the members of my dissertation committee, Gustavo Ponce and Paul Atzberger, for their support during my stay at UC Santa Barbara.

Thanks to Fuzzy Rogers and Paul Weakliem for helping with my computational needs, and to David Valdman for the insight that the amazing algorithm I `discovered' was actually just an implementation of the Singular Value Decomposition.

Finally, thanks to Peter Kuchment, for introducing me to real mathematics, and to Michael Crandall, for holding me to a higher standard than I held myself~to.
